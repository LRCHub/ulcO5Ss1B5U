Who's somebody you know
you shouldn't call?
Who were you kissing
in the back of your car?
Who's the one,
the one who got away?
Who are you thinking of
when you end your day?
'Cause I know you can see
we're more than a secret
You know
I can be just what you want
'Cause I've been out
until the morning
And I don't think
I'll last another night
I knew the feeling
would be forming
After I took a look
into your eyes
But are you ready for it,
darling?
I'll take
on your responsibilities
And you've got everybody calling
But I know that
you're calling after me
Don't play dumb,
I know you fantasize
You could have me on my back
every night
I don't mind the things that
you've been doing
Think you need someone like me
to get through it
And I know you can see
we'll have people talking
You know
we can be just what they want
'Cause I've been out
until the morning
And I don't think
I'll last another night
I knew the feeling
would be forming
After I took a look
into your eyes
But are you ready for it,
darling?
I'll take
on your responsibilities
And you've got everybody calling
But I know that
you're calling after me
'Cause I've been out
until the morning
And I don't think
I'll last another night
I knew the feeling
would be forming
After I took a look
into your eyes
But are you ready for it,
darling?
I'll take
on your responsibilities
And you've got everybody calling
But I know that you're calling
after me
You're calling after me
